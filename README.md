**Problem Statement:** The goal of this project is to develop a chatbot tailored for the coal industry, capable of providing information and assistance to various stakeholders involved in coal-related activities. The chatbot should serve as a helpful tool for farmers, drivers, environmentalists, legal staff, employees of Coal India Limited (CCL), miners, drillers, and individuals facing emergencies in coal mines.

**Our Approach to solve the problem**: Understanding User Roles and Needs:
User Research: Conduct research to understand the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in the coal industry, including farmers, drivers, environmentalists, legal staff, CCL employees, miners, drillers, and individuals facing emergencies.
Identify Information Needs: Determine the specific information needs and challenges faced by each user group to tailor the chatbot's responses accordingly.
2. Designing User Interaction Flow:
User Identification: Develop a user-friendly interface to prompt users to identify their role within the coal industry.
Question Selection: Design a structured question selection process to guide users in choosing relevant topics or inquiries.
Exit Option: Implement an easy-to-use exit option for users to terminate the chatbot session when needed.
3. Content Development:
Content Compilation: Gather comprehensive information on various aspects of the coal industry, including benefits, environmental impacts, safety measures, legal regulations, and emergency procedures.
Role-Specific Responses: Craft responses tailored to each user role, providing relevant information based on the user's identified occupation and selected question.

**Our Commitment:**
We are committed to delivering a high-quality chatbot solution that meets the diverse needs of stakeholders in the coal industry. By understanding user roles, designing intuitive interactions, and leveraging advanced technologies, we aim to create a valuable tool that enhances information access and facilitates effective communication within the coal community.
